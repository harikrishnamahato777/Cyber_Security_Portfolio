## 👤 ABOUT SECTION

**Title:** Building Defense Through Practice

**Content:**

I am a Cyber Security student with a strong foundation in computer networks, system configuration, and problem-solving. My approach to learning centers on practical application—understanding not just what security measures exist, but why they work and how they can be bypassed.

I actively practice hands-on learning through platforms like TryHackMe and work on projects that strengthen my understanding of real-world security concepts. From network packet analysis to understanding system vulnerabilities, I'm building the technical foundation needed for defensive security operations.

My goal is to start my career as a SOC Analyst or Ethical Hacker and grow through continuous learning and real incident exposure. I believe that effective security comes from understanding both the attacker's methodology and the defender's toolkit—and I'm committed to mastering both perspectives.
